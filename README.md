# SEMinR Issue Triage

Issue triage and release planning for [sem-in-r/seminr](https://github.com/sem-in-r/seminr).

## Structure

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `triage.md` | Main development queue: priorities, ready-to-work items, backlog |
| `next-release.md` | PRs merged to `develop`, issues to close on next release |
| `releases/` | Archived release notes and closed issues |

## For Maintainers

Clone this repo alongside the seminr source. Set up `CLAUDE.local.md` to point to your local seminr checkout for cross-repo code investigation.
